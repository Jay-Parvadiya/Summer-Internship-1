# Summer Internship 2024
Welcome to my GitHub repository of my 6-week Summer Internship 2024, during 4th semester summer breaks. During this internship, I worked on Python project under my external guide of company Multiminds Technology., which an e-learning provider company.

# Technologies Used
Pytho Modle :- Flask, Selenium, Pyautogui etc.

# Progress:

# ðŸ“… Week 1

May 15, 2024:
âœ… Today, I immersed myself in the basics of the GitHub, gaining a solid understanding of GitHub. It was exciting to dive into these technologies, each playing a crucial role in modern web development. 

May 16, 2024:
âœ… I recall python basic and see some real life project of python and also gain knowlage how and where python is use in real life project. 

May 17, 2024:
âœ… To facilitate smooth version control and collaboration with team members, I set up a Git repository and a remote GitHub repository. This step was essential for tracking changes and coordinating our efforts effectively. 

May 18, 2024:
âœ… Today, External guid give me task to creat mini python project. I created simple calculatore using python.

# ðŸ“… Week-2 

May 20, 2024:
âœ… Today, I learn Flask Module in python. And also learn application and use case of this module in real life porject.

May 21, 2024:
âœ… Focus on handling forms and user input in Flask applications, implementing basic form validation techniques. 

May 22, 2024:
âœ… Explore advanced topics such as user authentication, authorization, and session management. Implement user registration, login functionality, and secure routes based on authentication status. 

May 23, 2024:
âœ… Begin by understanding the principles and architecture of RESTful APIs. Learn about HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes (200, 201, 400, 404). Implement a basic API endpoint using a framework like Flask or Django, focusing on handling GET requests to retrieve data.

May 24, 2024:
âœ… Dive deeper into RESTful API development by learning how to create and manage resources. Implement POST and PUT methods to create and update resources. Explore serialization and deserialization techniques to convert Python objects to JSON format and vice versa. Test your API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl to ensure they behave as expected.

May 25, 2024:
âœ… Explore authentication and authorization mechanisms for securing your RESTful APIs. Implement token-based authentication using libraries like Flask-JWT or Django REST Framework's authentication classes. Learn about rate limiting, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), and other advanced concepts to enhance the security and performance of your APIs.
